- 👋 Hi, I’m @gustavKlingbiel, your friendly neighbourhood student actuary on a quest to become a certified wizard in the world of numbers!
- 👀 I’m interested in actuary stuff, insurtech sorcery, and using AI to turn claims into mere myths. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to tame advanced AI techniques without accidentally summoning a digital monster. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make claims processing smoother than a freshly brewed cup of coffee (which, by the way, I consume in large quantities!).
- 📫 How to reach me: I’m probably lurking on GitHub or trying to figure out LinkedIn like it’s a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love hiking in the Drakensberg mountains, where I pretend to be a mountain goat, and I’m also a coffee fan—my lifeblood and spirit animal!
- 📝 Yes, ChatGPT wrote this! (Don’t worry, it’s not plotting to take over the world… yet!)
